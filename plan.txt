summary of project requirement:

1. read from data files
2. data is stored in the format of "label  value"
3. label can be the following values:
	0	fetch instruction
	2	read memory data
	3 	write data in memory

4. value is a 32-bit hex address
5. memory address is 32 bit
6. memory access is 16-bit
7. write-back, write-allocate
8. all caches are initially empty
9. data bus uses first come first serve arbitration policy
10. feching a block from memory takes 10 cycles
11. flushing a dirty cache block is free
12. the caches are blocking: if there is a cache miss, the cache cannot process further requests from the processor.


basic structure of simulation tool:

1. command line interfacing module
	
	taking in command line instructions in the format of 

		coherence "protocol" "input_file" "no_of_processors" "cache_size" "associativity" "block_size"

2.
